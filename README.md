- This crawler/scraper should start scraping from one place, look at the site from an AI and structure perspective, and extract the data as JSON.
- If there are any links in the page, we should follow them, but we should ask the user first.
- If there are any images etc. we should write code using AI to generate the code to fetch them.

- I want this to automatically discover data types of extracted jsons and generate typescript types with quicktype.
- Then we use AI to analyze the types and rename them.
- Then we can use that + sample data to generate a zod or arctype schema.
